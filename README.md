## Description

This project is a clone of the `wc` command line tool, created as part of the coding challenges series by John Cricket. The `wc` command is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems to display the number of lines, words, and characters in a file.

## Features
- **File Size:** Displays the size of a given file in bytes.
- **Line Count:** Displays the number of lines in a given file.
